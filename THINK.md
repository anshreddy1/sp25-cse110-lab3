# Browser Support Risks for :has() and Nested Selectors

According to caniuse.com, the `:has()` relational selector and nested selector syntax are not supported in Safari versions prior to 15.4, and many legacy mobile/enterprise browsers lack support as well. Using these selectors without fallbacks can break layouts or interactive styles for users on older devices. We therefore use them only for nonâ€‘critical cosmetic enhancements, ensuring core functionality remains intact for all users.
